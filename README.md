# Distributed-Systems-Engineering-Project


### Temporary Description

The goal of the project is to experiment and fine-tune the CodeBERT Masked Language Model, to then deploy it to a simple microservice-based web application written using the SpringBoot framework

## The Data

To fine-tune the CodeBERT MLM I used 36 opensource java-based projects, the choice of the projects was not random for a model which needs to succesfully predict a mask in a code must be trained on 'high quality' code, i.e. that written by hihghly experienced software engineers from either FAANG companies or from the Apache Software Foundation.
The code from the projects will be used as both training set and test set, the specifics of which projects are used as what are in the experiment's notebooks
